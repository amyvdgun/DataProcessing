	#You can now load the data by writing some JavaScript that selects the text area (document.getElementById(…)) and then access its content. The content should be split into lines and then further split into two chunks, one for the date and one for the average temperature. Now create an array of data points and use console.log(…) to see whether the data was in fact loaded. Before moving on, make sure that the dates are in fact JavaScript dates and the numbers JavaScript numbers. To convert date strings to JavaScript dates use the Date function: new Date(dateString). Make sure that the dateString matches the example’s formatting.
