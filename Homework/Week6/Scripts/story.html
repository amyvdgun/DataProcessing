Write a short description of your data and the story that you want to tell with it (you can create a separate tab for it on your website or place the text under your visualisations). Check whether the description matches with the design and the functionality of your interactive linked views. Which storytelling model and which genre(s) do you use? Did you make your point? <br>

<p1>Two types of visualizations are used in this project. There has been chosen for a map of the USA that presents two things: on the one hand all the states and their geographical location and on the other hand their population. In this way, by hovering over the map and by analyzing the colors, it can be seen very quickly what the most densely populated states are. What is striking, is that the largest states do not necessarily have the highest populations. The state California has the highest population of all states. You might wonder how many </p1>

<p2> That is where the barchart comes in. By clicking on a particular state, the barchart represents the annual amount of babies born in that state for the years 2011 to 2017. </p1>

Describe the design process and for each step all your design choices (in separate pdf document). You can simply use bullet points so that we can follow the steps that you have taken. Think about the specific design choices for each visualisation, interaction design, the overall website design and also about the technical design (e.g. how do your visualisations communicate?).
