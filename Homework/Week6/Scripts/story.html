	  	<h1>Story behind the data</h1>
	  	<p1>Two types of visualizations are used in this project. There has been chosen for a map of the USA that presents two things: on the one hand all the states and their geographical location and on the other hand their population. In this way, by hovering over the map and by analyzing the colors, it can be seen very quickly what the most densely populated states are. What is striking, is that the largest states do not necessarily have the highest populations. The state California has the highest population of all states. You might wonder how many </p1> <br>

		<p2> That is where the barchart comes in. By clicking on a particular state, the barchart represents the annual amount of babies born in that state for the years 2011 to 2017. </p1> <br>
